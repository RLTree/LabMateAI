   - **Collaborative filtering**: Recommends tools based on the preferences of other users with similar research interests or tool usage patterns.
   - **Hybrid filtering**: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering to offer personalized and well-rounded suggestions.

3. **Categorized Recommendations**:
   LabMateAI organizes tools into specific categories, such as genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics, and more, making it easier for users to discover tools within their research area.

4. **Keyword Search**:
   LabMateAI allows users to perform keyword-based searches to find tools related to specific scientific tasks or methodologies. This feature helps researchers quickly identify tools based on their requirements.

5. **Tool Similarity**:
   By analyzing the relationships between tools using graph-based algorithms, LabMateAI identifies similar tools and presents them to users who might be exploring alternatives or complementary software.
