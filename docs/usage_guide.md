## Features and Commands

### 1. Tool Similarity Recommendations

**Purpose**: Find tools that are similar to a specific tool you already use.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Option 1**: Enter `1` at the main menu and press **Enter**.
2. **Enter the Tool Name**: When prompted, type the name of the tool (e.g., `BLAST`) and press **Enter**.
3. **Specify Number of Recommendations**: Enter the number of recommendations you want (default is 5).
4. **View Recommendations**: LabMateAI will display a list of similar tools.

**Example**:

```
Enter the name of the tool you are using:
> BLAST
Enter the number of recommendations you would like (default is 5):
> 3
Here are 3 tools similar to BLAST:
1. Clustal Omega - A tool for multiple sequence alignment.
2. MAFFT - A fast multiple sequence alignment program.
3. MUSCLE - Advanced software for multiple sequence alignment.
```

### 2. Category-Based Recommendations

**Purpose**: Discover tools within a specific scientific category.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Option 2**: Enter `2` at the main menu and press **Enter**.
2. **Enter the Category Name**: Type the name of the category (e.g., `Genomics`) and press **Enter**.
3. **View Tools in Category**: LabMateAI will display a list of tools within that category.

**Example**:

```
Enter the category you are interested in:
> Genomics
Here are tools in the Genomics category:
1. BWA - A software package for mapping low-divergent sequences.
2. Bowtie2 - A fast and sensitive gapped read aligner.
3. HISAT2 - A fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads.
...
```

### 3. Keyword-Based Search

**Purpose**: Search for tools based on keywords related to your research.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Option 3**: Enter `3` at the main menu and press **Enter**.
2. **Enter the Keyword**: Type your keyword (e.g., `RNA-seq`) and press **Enter**.
3. **View Search Results**: LabMateAI will display tools that match your keyword.

**Example**:

```
Enter the keyword to search for tools:
> RNA-seq
Tools matching your search:
1. DESeq2 - Differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution.
2. EdgeR - Empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R.
3. Kallisto - A program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq data.
...
```

## Advanced Usage

LabMateAI is designed to be straightforward, but here are some advanced tips:

- **Partial Tool Names**: You can enter partial tool names, and LabMateAI will attempt to find the closest match.
- **Case Insensitive**: Inputs are not case-sensitive, so `blast` and `BLAST` are treated the same.
- **Abbreviations**: Common abbreviations may be recognized (e.g., `NGS` for Next-Generation Sequencing).

---

## Tips and Tricks

- **Explore New Categories**: Don't hesitate to explore categories you're less familiar with; you might discover useful tools.
- **Combine Keywords**: Use general keywords to get broader results (e.g., `alignment`, `visualization`).
- **Stay Updated**: LabMateAI's tool database is regularly updated. Ensure you have the latest version installed.
