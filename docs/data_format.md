# **LabMateAI Data Format Guide**

This document provides an overview of the data format used by **LabMateAI**, which now interacts with the `labmateai-db` Heroku app utilizing PostgreSQL. The PostgreSQL database stores and manages scientific tools, replacing the previous `tools.json` file format. This guide will help developers and contributors understand the structure of the database and how to interact with it.

## General Structure

The LabMateAI system now stores tool data in a PostgreSQL database hosted on the Heroku app `labmateai-db`. The main table used for managing tools is `TOOL`, and it contains the following fields:

- **tool_id**: A unique identifier for each tool.
- **name**: The name of the tool.
- **category**: The category the tool belongs to (e.g., Genomics, Bioinformatics, etc.).
- **features**: A list of features associated with the tool.
- **cost**: The cost of using the tool (e.g., Free, Paid).
- **description**: A brief description of the tool.
- **url**: The URL linking to the tool's homepage.
- **language**: The programming language associated with the tool (optional).
- **platform**: The platform(s) supported by the tool (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Web-Based).

---

## Field Descriptions

Here’s a breakdown of each field in the `TOOL` table:

1. **`tool_id`** (integer, primary key):
   - The unique identifier for each tool.
   - Automatically generated by PostgreSQL when a new tool is added.

2. **`name`** (string):
   - The name of the scientific tool.
   - **Example**: `"name": "BLAST"`

3. **`category`** (string):
   - The category or domain of the tool, such as Genomics, Bioinformatics, Proteomics, etc.
   - **Example**: `"category": "Genomics"`

4. **`features`** (string array):
   - A list of features that describe the tool’s functionality. This field helps identify tools with similar attributes.
   - **Example**: `"features": ["Sequence Alignment", "Genome Analysis", "Data Visualization"]`

5. **`cost`** (string):
   - The cost model of the tool (e.g., Free, Paid, Freemium).
   - **Example**: `"cost": "Free"`

6. **`description`** (text):
   - A brief description of the tool’s functionality.
   - **Example**: `"description": "A tool for comparing nucleotide or protein sequences against a database."`

7. **`url`** (string):
   - The official website URL or documentation link for the tool.
   - **Example**: `"url": "https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"`

8. **`language`** (string, optional):
   - The programming language associated with the tool.
   - **Example**: `"language": "Python"`

9. **`platform`** (string, optional):
   - The supported platform(s) for the tool (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Web-Based).
   - **Example**: `"platform": "Web-Based"`

## Example Entry

Here’s a sample entry from the PostgreSQL `TOOL` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO TOOL (name, category, features, cost, description, url, language, platform) 
VALUES (
  'BLAST', 
  'Genomics', 
  '{"Sequence Alignment", "Genome Analysis", "Database Search"}', 
  'Free', 
  'Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for comparing nucleotide or protein sequences against a database.', 
  'https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/', 
  'C++', 
  'Web-Based'
);
```

In this example:
- The tool **BLAST** belongs to the **Genomics** category.
- It offers features like **Sequence Alignment** and **Genome Analysis**.
- The tool is **Free** and includes a description and URL to its homepage.

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool to the **LabMateAI** PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

### 1. Connect to the PostgreSQL Database

You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using a client like `psql` or a tool like **pgAdmin**. Ensure that you have the correct credentials for accessing the `labmateai-db` Heroku app.

### 2. Insert a New Tool Entry

Run the following SQL command to insert a new tool into the `TOOL` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO TOOL (name, category, features, cost, description, url, language, platform) 
VALUES (
  'FastQC', 
  'Bioinformatics', 
  '{"Quality Control", "NGS Data", "Sequence Analysis"}', 
  'Free', 
  'A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data.', 
  'https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/', 
  'Java', 
  'Windows, macOS, Linux'
);
```

### 3. Save the Changes

Once the tool has been added, the new entry will be automatically committed to the database.

---

## Modifying Existing Tools

If you need to update an existing tool (e.g., modify its description or add features), follow these steps:

### 1. Locate the Tool

Find the tool using its `tool_id` or `name` by running a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TOOL WHERE name = 'BLAST';
```

### 2. Update the Fields

Run an SQL `UPDATE` command to modify the desired fields. For example, to add a feature to **BLAST**, you could run:

```sql
UPDATE TOOL 
SET features = '{"Sequence Alignment", "Genome Analysis", "Database Search", "Protein Matching"}' 
WHERE name = 'BLAST';
```

### 3. Save the Changes

After executing the `UPDATE` statement, the changes will be automatically saved.

## Important Notes

1. **Field Consistency**: Ensure that every tool entry includes all required fields. Missing fields can cause issues with the recommendation system.
2. **Category Standardization**: To maintain consistency, ensure that categories are uniformly named across all tools.
3. **Database Schema**: Ensure that any modifications to the database schema (e.g., adding new fields) are properly tested and do not break the existing functionality.

---

By following this guide, you’ll be able to add, update, or remove scientific tools from **LabMateAI**'s PostgreSQL database. This format allows for greater flexibility and scalability, enabling the system to grow as new tools and categories are added.
